 Function name    : CanNmAppl_IncompatibleGenerator

 Description      : This is CanNmAppl function called when the Incompatible version of the generator
                    is used in comparison to what was originally used.
                    This error is detected during CanNm_Init() function call
                    If there is an error, then CanNm module will remain in NM_STATE_UNINIT.
                    It will not be possible to use the module functionality, in case of this failure
                    NOTE : If DET is enabled, then most of APIs check if the module is initialised. If DET is disabled
                    most of the APIs will not check for uninitialised state. If the module APIs are called when this
                    error happens , s/w might go to trap.
                    Hence user has to ensure that when this error is detected, module APIs are not called. Ex : Don't
                    start OS
                    This function is called only when post-build loadable feature is used.
 Parameter        : void
 Return value     : void
